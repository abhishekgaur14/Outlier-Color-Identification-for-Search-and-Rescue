#Outlier Color Identification for Search and Rescue
This project implements four anomaly detection algorithms to find outliers in an image. The outliers are defined as pixels that have a distinguishing color than the rest of the surroundings.
<br>
The idea of this project was to locate a stranded person in some remote place using the drone footage.

**How to run?**
<br>
Each folder has a matlab script named after the folder itself. That is the main script and the other scripts are functions that this script uses for different tasks. Run the main script by giving a custom input image by changing the 'imread' part of the code.
